# Outpatient at Seacroft

## Nature of project
An app looking at Outpatient room concentration of a contaminant, the concentration is found,
then for the time a patient is in a room, the dose can be obtained. By assuming a pathogen
the risk can be obtained. The next bit of code can be used for scheduling the patients, 
giving them a room with a suitable level of risk.

This will help reduce outpatient room cross infection. This is important as it will be
looking at a cystic fibrosis clinic; people who are vulnerable to cross infections
